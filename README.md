# Machine Learning Projects
In this repository are included some projects that I have done in supervised learning (classification and regression) and unsupervised learning for IBM professional specialization.
The project contains concise and compact pdf versions of the main jupyter notebook files. Not all steps contained in the main jupyter notebook files are
shown in their pdf versions.
